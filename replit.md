# Overview

This is a Flask-based AI prompt engineering service designed to enhance and optimize text prompts for image generation models. The application analyzes user input prompts and applies intelligent enhancements using predefined style keywords and negative prompt defaults to improve the quality and specificity of AI-generated images. The service categorizes prompt elements into photography techniques, art styles, quality descriptors, mood settings, and composition rules to create more effective prompts for image generation APIs.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Backend Framework
The application uses Flask as the web framework, providing a lightweight and flexible foundation for the prompt enhancement service. Flask was chosen for its simplicity and rapid development capabilities, making it ideal for this focused API service.

## Prompt Enhancement Engine
The core functionality revolves around a heuristics-based system that categorizes and enhances prompts using predefined keyword dictionaries. The system organizes enhancement terms into five main categories:

- **Photography**: Technical camera and lighting terms
- **Art Styles**: Various artistic mediums and aesthetic movements  
- **Quality**: Terms that improve output fidelity and detail
- **Mood**: Emotional and atmospheric descriptors
- **Composition**: Visual arrangement and framing techniques

## Negative Prompt Management
The application includes a comprehensive negative prompting system that automatically filters out common artifacts and unwanted elements. The negative defaults are categorized into:

- Anatomical and structural issues
- Image quality artifacts
- Branding and text elements
- Style-related problems

## Configuration Management
Environment-based configuration is implemented for sensitive settings like session secrets, with fallback defaults for development environments. This ensures security in production while maintaining ease of development.

## API Structure
The service is designed as a RESTful API that accepts text prompts and returns enhanced versions with appropriate style keywords and negative prompts applied. The architecture supports JSON-based request/response patterns for easy integration with frontend applications or other services.

# External Dependencies

## Core Framework
- **Flask**: Web application framework for handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Python Standard Library**: Utilizes `re` for pattern matching, `json` for data serialization, `os` for environment variables, and `textwrap` for text formatting

## Runtime Environment
- **Python 3.x**: Runtime environment for the application
- **Flask Development Server**: Built-in server for development and testing

## Potential Integrations
The architecture is designed to integrate with AI image generation services that accept text prompts, though no specific external APIs are currently implemented in the codebase. The prompt enhancement output format suggests compatibility with popular AI art generation platforms.
