# Overview

This is a highly optimized Flask-based Universal Prompt Optimizer that transforms rough creative ideas into professional, platform-ready prompts for multiple AI generation services. The application uses heuristic analysis to categorize and enhance user input, generating optimized prompts for SDXL, ComfyUI, Midjourney v6, Pika Labs, and Runway ML. The system follows strict prompt structure ordering (quality → subject → style → lighting → composition → mood → color grade → extra tags) and includes comprehensive negative prompting, platform-specific configuration hints, database-backed API key authentication with expiry dates, daily usage quotas with individual user limits, Stripe webhook integration for automated key provisioning, comprehensive admin endpoints for manual key management, Quick Share to Social functionality for automatic posting to Twitter/X, Instagram, and LinkedIn with branded Chaos Venice Productions content, Automated Lead Follow-Up System with personalized email campaigns for download and hire us triggers, Dynamic Portfolio Engine with Auto-Sell Flow that transforms every generated asset into a passive sales tool with automatic curation, engagement analytics, and direct revenue paths through commission orders and image licensing, and Advanced Automated Upsell Follow-Up Sequence that maximizes revenue from every portfolio lead through tiered pricing offers, countdown timers, and sophisticated 4-step email automation.

# System Architecture

## Backend Framework
The application uses Flask as the web framework, providing a lightweight and flexible foundation for the prompt enhancement service. Flask was chosen for its simplicity and rapid development capabilities, making it ideal for this focused API service.

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Performance**: WAL mode journaling with 30-second timeout, optimized SQLite connection pooling, and comprehensive indexing strategy across 12 critical tables for sub-100ms query response times
- **Memory Management**: LRU caching with configurable size limits, optimized JSON serialization without pretty-printing, and efficient row factory for dictionary-like database access
- **Type Safety**: Complete type annotations and null-safety checks for SMTP connections, scheduler operations, and email processing to eliminate runtime errors
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced exception handling with graceful fallbacks, comprehensive logging, and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Response Optimization**: Disabled JSON key sorting for better caching, optimized JSONIFY responses, and efficient memory usage patterns

## Prompt Enhancement Engine
The core functionality uses a sophisticated heuristics-based system that follows industry best practices for AI prompt engineering. Key features:

- **Strict Ordering**: Enforces quality → subject → style → lighting → composition → mood → color grade → extra tags structure for optimal results
- **Platform Optimization**: Generates format-specific outputs for SDXL, ComfyUI, Midjourney v6, Pika Labs, and Runway ML
- **Character Limits**: Automatically clamps prompts to 800-850 characters to prevent quality degradation
- **Keyword Categories**: Photography techniques, art styles, quality descriptors, mood settings, and composition rules
- **Deduplication**: Removes conflicting styles and duplicate terms while preserving order

## Negative Prompt Management
The application includes a comprehensive negative prompting system that automatically filters out common artifacts and unwanted elements. The negative defaults are categorized into:

- Anatomical and structural issues
- Image quality artifacts
- Branding and text elements
- Style-related problems
