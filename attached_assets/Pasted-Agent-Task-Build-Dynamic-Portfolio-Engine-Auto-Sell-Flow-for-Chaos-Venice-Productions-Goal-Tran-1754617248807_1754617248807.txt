Agent Task:
Build Dynamic Portfolio Engine + Auto-Sell Flow for Chaos Venice Productions

Goal:
Transform Chaos Venice’s public portfolio into a fully automated sales funnel that updates in real time with our best, most engaging creative works. Every portfolio piece must have a direct path to purchase or commission without manual intervention.

Core Features
Automatic Content Curation

Monitor all new generations from authenticated users in real time.

Filter for top-performing images based on:

Highest engagement on share pages.

Most ZIP downloads.

Most social shares.

Push these automatically into a public “Featured Works” section.

Dynamic Portfolio Pages

Cinematic grid layout with hover previews.

Each image opens a detail page showing:

Parameters used.

Platform (SDXL, ComfyUI, etc.).

“Order Similar” button (pre-fills contact form with the parameters).

“License This Image” button with instant payment checkout.

Auto-generated SEO titles & descriptions for every new piece.

Sales-Optimized CTAs

“Order Similar” → Contact form with image preview & parameter lock.

“Commission a Project” → Payment page with tiered options.

Add upsell suggestion for higher-end packages.

Lead & Sale Tracking

Every click on an image → tracked in SQLite.

Every order → instantly emailed to orders@chaosvenice.com with customer info.

Admin panel to view portfolio stats: views, clicks, conversions.

Email Integration

Featured Works section updated daily → triggers “Portfolio Update” email to all captured leads.

Emails are branded and cinematic, highlighting 3–5 new works with direct order links.

Technical Requirements
Pulls from the existing SQLite DB used by Universal Prompt Optimizer.

Uses same branding/theme as share pages (dark + teal/magenta neon).

Optimized for speed — image thumbnails served via CDN or compressed preview.

Secure endpoints for managing what’s “featured” (manual override possible).

Works seamlessly on desktop & mobile.

Acceptance Criteria:

No manual upload — all featured portfolio updates happen automatically based on engagement.

Every portfolio item has direct revenue action (order/license).

Portfolio changes trigger branded email updates automatically.

Admin can see which works bring in the most orders.

Once complete, this will ensure every generated asset is a passive sales tool that feeds Chaos Venice Productions’ revenue stream without manual effort.
