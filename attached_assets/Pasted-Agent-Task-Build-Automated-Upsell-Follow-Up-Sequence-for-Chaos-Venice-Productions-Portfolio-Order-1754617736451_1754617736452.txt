Agent Task:
Build Automated Upsell & Follow-Up Sequence for Chaos Venice Productions Portfolio Orders

Goal:
Maximize revenue from every portfolio lead by automatically presenting upsell offers and follow-up sequences after a user expresses purchase intent.

Core Features
Trigger Points

Any click on “Order Similar” or “Commission a Project” instantly triggers the upsell workflow.

Trigger also fires when a lead downloads a ZIP file from a share page.

Upsell Offer Page

Immediately after intent, user is redirected to an Upsell Page with:

Large preview of the image they’re ordering.

Tiered offer table (e.g., Basic Pack, Premium Pack, Full Commercial License).

Scarcity elements (“Offer valid for 24 hours” countdown timer).

Payment buttons linked to Stripe Checkout.

Email Follow-Up Sequence

If purchase not completed:

Hour 1: Email reminder with image preview and “Complete Your Order” button.

Hour 12: Email offering a small discount or bonus asset if they purchase now.

Day 2: Email with “Behind the Scenes” insight about the creation process to re-engage.

Day 4: Final “Last Chance” email before the offer expires.

Post-Purchase Upsell

After any purchase, redirect to Post-Purchase Offer Page:

“Since you loved this, why not get an exclusive 10-image set in the same style?”

One-click Stripe checkout, discounted price.

Lead Capture Integration

All triggered leads are stored in SQLite + synced with our email marketing service (e.g., MailerLite, ConvertKit, or custom SMTP).

Include tag data for what image/offer they clicked so follow-up can be personalized.

Admin Dashboard Controls

Set offer tiers, pricing, discount timers.

View upsell conversion rates, abandoned carts, completed sales.

Technical Requirements
Integrates with current SQLite lead system and Stripe API.

Emails use the Chaos Venice Productions branding (dark, neon teal/magenta cinematic theme).

Upsell pages mobile-responsive and optimized for speed.

Countdown timers persist between sessions using localStorage and server timestamps.

Acceptance Criteria:

Any purchase intent triggers immediate upsell workflow.

System captures & follows up on every abandoned checkout.

Post-purchase upsells are live and converting.

Admin can monitor performance and adjust offers without code edits.

This turns every casual portfolio viewer into a high-value buyer by pushing them through a proven revenue-maximizing funnel automatically.
